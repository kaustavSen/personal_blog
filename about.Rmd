Thanks for stopping by! My name is Kaustav Sen and I am an actuary by training. I am currently working with a consultancy firm based out of India.

Statistics and mathematics has always fascinated me. Before starting work I studied for a Bachelor's degree in statistics. This blog is my way of keeping in touch with the latest developments and also as an outlet for my learning experiences, which currently include R for visualization and analysis, D3.js and web development in general.
